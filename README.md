# Python Newsfeed

##  

# Description
The goal of this project was to demonstrate/learn the ability to use Python as a basis for a web server. I refactored an existing full stack javascript project and converted it to Python. I utilized Flask as the framework, SQLAlchemy as the ORM (Object-relational mapper) and PyMySQL as the means to connect my application to a MySQL database. I utilized bcrypt to hash passwords and python-dotenv to manage environment variables inside of venv (virtual environment). Lasty using Gunicorn to deploy due to the Flask built-in web server not being meant to run in a production environment.
